# Getting started

{% hint style="danger" %}
While in private alpha, you should expect bugs and us hard at work fixing them. Server restarts, purging and data loss are commonplace so  
- DO NOT use in production or in critical dev environments.  
- DO NOT upload any critical files  
- DO NOT share an information like passwords, payment details etc... on any part of the system.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We are in private alpha and have a waitlist of developers who want to try us out. During our alpha, all uploads and downloads are free of cost.
